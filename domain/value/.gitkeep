When you care only about the attributes and logic of an element of the model, classify it as 
a value object. Make it express the meaning of the attributes it conveys and give it related 
functionality.  Treat  the  value  object  as  immutable.  Make  all  operations  Side-effect-free 
Functions  that don’t depend on any mutable state. Don’t give a value object any identity 
and avoid the design complexities necessary to maintain entities.
