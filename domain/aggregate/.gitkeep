Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each. 
Choose  one  entity  to  be  the  root  of  each  aggregate,  and  allow  external  objects  to  hold 
references  to  the  root  only  (references  to  internal members  passed  out  for  use  within  a 
single operation only). Define properties and invariants  for  the aggregate as a whole and 
give enforcement responsibility to the root or some designated framework mechanism.
